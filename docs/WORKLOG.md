# Work log (shared by Codex and Claude Code)

Newest first. One entry per finished piece of work: date, agent, what changed, what is live, what is open.
The website has its own log in the `mindlap-therapy` repo (`docs/WORKLOG.md`).

## 2026-10-25 · Codex · cross-project security review

- Added `docs/SECURITY-REVIEW-2026-10-25.md` in both projects. Three high-priority
  findings: manager can edit an existing admin login email, booking mutations
  bypass booking permission, and Worker capture failures still confirm paid status.
- Four medium findings cover clinical permission revocation, contact lookup,
  workflow internal destinations and missing booking-app browser security headers.
- Six offline synthetic probes confirmed the paths; script is in the website repo
  at `tools/security/review-checks.cjs`. No production data or real payments touched.
- Live sampled private routes denied unauthenticated access; production npm audit
  reported no known advisories, full audit found four moderate affected dev packages
  in one esbuild chain. AWS/network/backups and legacy services need separate verification.
- All findings open. No live behaviour changed. Prioritise S1-S3 before further import.

## 2026-10-25 · Codex · shared system overview

- Added `docs/OVERVIEW.md` with Aflah's ecosystem summary, completed work, pending
  migrations, owner decisions and handover guidance; linked it from `AGENTS.md`.
- Identical overview saved in the website repo. Documentation only; live behaviour unchanged.
- Open: MCH export, dry run and Aflah's count review remain next. No migration run.

## 2026-10-25 · Claude Code · state at handover

Live (main `1d37586`):
- Case history in MCH's six steps and fields, Severe risk level, MCH session note fields, MCH client code.
- Reassigning a client's psychologist moves their open follow-up thread too.
- "Most sessions per psychologist per day" setting (set to 7), counted across services.
- Couple therapy 90 min; 30-minute gap after both services; couple packages 4/8/12.

Open:
- **MCH data import:** code ready (`scripts/import-mch.ts`, `deploy/mch/export.sql`). Next: export from the
  MCH server, dry run, show Aflah the counts, then `--commit` with `--create-missing-staff`. MCH has 303
  clients, 207 case histories, 411 session notes, 13 psychologists. Match by phone and staff name.
- Upcoming bookings stay with the old psychologist on reassignment (Aflah may want them moved).
- WhatsApp OTP via Meta (needs billing and a permanent token), Callyzer purchase on hold, Zoho CRM shutdown.
